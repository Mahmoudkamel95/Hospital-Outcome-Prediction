# üè• Hospital Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìò Project Overview
This project aims to predict **hospital patient outcomes (Discharge vs Expiry)** using real-world clinical data and machine learning algorithms.  
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in **early identification of high-risk patients**, enabling better resource allocation and timely interventions.

## üß† Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, inconsistent data, and incorrect data types.
   - Convert categorical variables to numeric formats.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Compute hospital stay duration and other derived metrics.
3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression (Baseline)
   - Random Forest + SMOTE
   - XGBoost + SMOTE
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - Validation: Stratified train/test split (80/20)
5. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Identify key medical factors influencing patient outcomes.
